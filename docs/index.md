# Solutions to **Introduction to Algorithms** _Third Edition_

## Getting Started

This website contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [**Introduction to Algorithms** _Third Edition_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

Hope to reorganize solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, it's much more readable on portable devices now.

Special thanks to [@JeffreyCA](https://github.com/JeffreyCA), who fixed math rendering on iOS Safari in [#26](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/pull/26).

If I miss your name here, please tell me!

Feel free to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted solutions. You can press the "pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/issues/new) in [my repository](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/).

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

All mathematical equations are rendered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), and I added `overflow-x: auto` to prevent overflow issue on small screen devices, so you can scroll horizontally in some math display equations.

## More Informations

I recently rebased my repository for clearer commit histories. Therefore, if you have forked the repository before, consider reforking it again.

For more informations, you can visit my GitHub: [walkccc (Jay Chen)](https://github.com/walkccc/).
